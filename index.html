                <h3>Karol Milewski</h3>
                <p>When the 2023 Wheelchair Olympia contest began, almost everyone expected five-time champion Harold “King Kong” Kelley to make it six wins in a row and remain the only champion in the division’s history. But he and everyone else in attendance were shocked when the dust settled and Karol Milewski came away with his first Olympia win. </p>

                <h3>Andrea Shaw</h3>
                <p>Andrea Shaw went into this year looking to defend both her Rising Phoenix World Championship and Ms. Olympia titles. She had already won each show for the past three years, and her goal was to snag a four-peat. And she did so in dominant fashion.</p>

                <h3>Andrew Jacked</h3>
                <p>Much like Dauda, Andrew Jacked also had a packed 2023 season. He started the year by finishing third at the 2023 Arnold Classic. He then won the 2023 Texas Pro, which qualified him for the 2023 Mr Olympia contest.</p>
